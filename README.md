## Wireframes

The wireframes for Foodie were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). My wireframes include full-width displays and also small and mobile displays. The final site does start slightly from the wireframes due to differences within the development of the site and my own abilities.

## Site Structure

Foodie website has seven pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, the login page, the recipe form, the recipe page, recipes and the register page

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font chosen was 'Playfair Display'. This was choosen to give the site a more classic and sleek look that match the classic style of a kitchen. 
      

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The color scheme was something I took a lot of time to choose. I wanted the webiste to match the classic black and white you see in more elegant kitches in resturants. This is seen throughout the site

# Features

Foodie site is set up to be welcoming and easy to use. The landing page is a very simple page with the logo at the top in the header acting as a link back to the index. The bottom has a footer which is a consistent theme throughout the pages with social buttons and an email for socials of the website.

## Existing Features  
  * ### Logo

    * Since the page is a very simple one with little navigation needed, the only present part is the clickable logo taking you back to the home page.

  * ### Add Recipe

      * Located To the left is the Add Recipe button which will take you to the page to add your own recipe

 * ### Recipes

    * This allows you to look at all the recipes that have been added to the database and be able to sort.

  * ### Login / Register
    
    * This lets the user log in or make a login to be able to add a recipe. This will use an Email which will be linked in the Database to use as a key.

* ### Footer
    
    * The Footer is present at the bottom of both of the pages. It contains an email at which you are able to contact the site owner for any queries. 
    * The footer also shows four social FontAwesome logos all of which lead to their respective sites for people to share scores.

## Future Features 

* I would like to add a way to sort the recipes into savoury and into desert for people to have even more ways to find what they want.

* I would like to add a share button on recipies tied to peoples social media. This way they can share the wesbite but also share recipes

* I would like to add a way to be able to link social media accounts and use the emails from them also as a login.
